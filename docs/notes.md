# Journal
- Document project — how I approached the problem, what challenges faced and how overcame, how the program works, what the key findings are, what would do with more time
- Daily document of what I did 

### Day 1 - Thu
- Gathered resources from entire course and formed a mental picture of how everything links together
- Explored resources in detail and noted files to return to in further detail and created a folder for grouping these files
- Set up planning structure with epics, user stories, acceptance criteria, and Kanban boards
- Improved knowledge of planning techniques and attempted to populate planning files, but struggled, so prepared questions for Q&A the next day

### Day 2 - Fri 
- Created the extract phase of the pipeline, along with unit and component tests 
- Fully understood the planning workflow, after asking for more info at the Q&A, and created an organised plan with epics, user stories, acceptance criteria, and Kanban boards for the project and my learning -- the learning board keeps a backlog of things to learn without interrupting delivery. Unsurprisingly, the planning workflow is very, very effective on many levels, and synergises exceptionally well with the systematic and logical nature of programming. Really enjoying it and excited to become really fluent at all software development practices; amazing skillset to have. 

### Day 3 - Mon 
- Completed the ETL pipeline with transform including cleaning, using data cleaning notebook exploration to understand what cleaning is required and get a first feel for the structure of the data. 
- Planned the final stages of Epic 1, in terms of Streamlit visualisations
- Came up with ideas for Epic 2, features and visualistions for app. These came to me whilst walking back from the gym. Good to step away. Thanks to my planning structure, these ideas are ready to be planned in detail and executed. Looking forward to this creative part. 
-  Realised I'm a bit confused by the load part of my pipeline and should ask for help. 
  
### Day 4 - Tue
- Completed the run_app-run_etl automation, which is nice, by bug-fixing the ETL pipeline and getting the app to run smoothly. 
- Added pages to the app and planned what contents to include. 
- Encountered issues with data cleaning and app logic, which was something of a headache - but I nearly resolved them and knew what to fix in the morning. 
- Began to have some ideas for my presentation narrative. Need to think in more detail on Thurs. I'll get there. 

### Day 5 - Wed
- Complete the 'build' phase of the project, consisting of the ETL pipeline and the contents of the app. All that remains is writing full unit test coverage and understanding component testing, etc., and implementing if time allows; and preparing for the presentation!
- Resolved the data loading twice on Streamlit; it was being imported twice with the logic I was using. Could not figure it out until I went for an evening walk, which caused me to figure out the remaining bugs. Stepping away works! 
- Worked on notebook data analysis to have enough insights for app. Happy with what I have produced -- though, there is always more you can do!

### Day 6 - Thu
- Completed unit testing, linting, and everything is running smoothly. Prepared for presentation and left open files needed for demonstration. Ironed out remaining creases by creating readme and tidying Kanban boards, user stories.

### Day 7 - Fri   
- Presented project!
