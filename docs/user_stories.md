## Epic 1 
```text
As a DATA ENGINEER
I want a working end-to-end data pipeline and Streamlit app
So that I have a MVP to add features to 
```

### USER STORY 1 - Extract Data 
```text
As a DATA ENGINEER/ANALYST
I want to be able to access the data from the .csv file
So that it can be transformed ready for analysis
```

- [x] Data is extracted from the .csv file  
- [x] Data is extracted in less than 30s 
- [x] Extraction occurs without errors and data integrity is maintained
- [x] Successful extractions are logged
- [x] Data is stored in Pandas DataFrame for further processing
- [x] Tests are written to verify the data extraction process 


### USER STORY 2 - Data Cleaning 
```text
As a DATA ENGINEER/ANALYST
I want to have clean data, standardised data 
So that it can be analysed easier
```
- [x] Thorough data cleaning exploration has been conducted

## Epic 2
```text
As a DATA ENGINEER
I want additional transformations, visualisations, and improved Streamlit page
So that the data analysis is more insightful and to improve user experience
```

## Epic 3
```text
As a DATA ENGINEER
I want full test coverage, including integration and end-to-end tests
So that the project code is fully robust and secure
